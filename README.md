# MasterFlightApp
This iOS app was developed to calculate the takeoff performance needed for a P-3 Orion aircraft.
The app is designed to be used on an iPad only due to the screen space needed to enter all applicable data from the user.
As of now, the app is not available on the App Store.  I am still trying to figure out how to accurately calculate refusal speed.

## Issues:
1.  App code needs to be updated to the current version of Swift.
2.  This app does not calculate refusal speed (v1 speed).  [Refusal Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds)
